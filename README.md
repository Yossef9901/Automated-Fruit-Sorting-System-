# Automated Fruit Sorting System
(Classification Based on Color, Size, and Ripeness)

##  Project Description
The Automated Fruit Sorting System is a software-based intelligent system designed to automatically classify and sort fruits using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes digital images of fruits and classifies them based on color, size, and ripeness without using any physical hardware.

##  Project Objectives
- Detect fruit color using image processing techniques.
- Measure fruit size automatically from images.
- Classify fruit ripeness accurately.
- Apply machine learning for high classification accuracy.
- Reduce manual sorting effort.
- Provide fast, reliable, and automatic fruit classification.

##  System Working Principle
1. The system loads fruit images from the dataset.
2. Images are preprocessed and segmented.
3. Fruit features such as color, size, and ripeness are extracted.
4. A machine learning model classifies the fruit.
5. The final classification result is displayed and saved.
